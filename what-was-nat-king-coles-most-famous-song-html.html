His easygoing nature and, most notably, his talent, spoke for themselves.</p><p id=par-4_48>“That was the great gift of his charisma,” Daniel Mark Epstein, the author of <a href=#>a 1999 biography</a> of the singer, said in a <a href=#>2019 conversation with NPR</a>. “That there was so much passion in his voice and so much intelligence, he was able to transcend the color barrier.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-74258688.jpg><p id=par-5_35>The “Mona Lisa” singer had been a heavy smoker and lived only to the age of 45 after succumbing to lung cancer. But his music and voice are still as beloved today as ever.</p><p id=par-6_50>“Nat King Cole’s voice is really one of the great gifts of nature,” Epstein added. “Remember, he was never trained as a singer. And so, his voice is absolutely pure. He’s a baritone with absolutely perfect pitch. He sings the notes true and he hits them right in the center.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Natalie Cole’s ‘Unforgettable’ “duet” with her father</h2><p id=par-7_68>In 1991, singer Natalie Cole moved away from her jazz and pop niche to release her album Unforgettable With Love. It was a love letter of sorts to her father, featuring her renditions of his most popular songs, including “Smile,” “Route 66,” and the song that put Natalie back on the map after a rough few years going in and out of rehab for drug abuse, “Unforgettable.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-901907536.jpg><p id=par-8_36>The latter song featured Natalie and Nat in <a href=#>a “virtual duet</a>,” a practice that, while regularly used now, was groundbreaking at the time, and brought the 1950s superstar back to life by way of a recording.</p><p id=par-9_57>She <a href=#>told The Independent</a>, “Nothing had been attempted like that. To lift Dad’s voice, literally, off of that track and put it on a brand new one, and then line it up, match it up, get the phrasing right. I remember listening – everyone listening at the end, and we were just enthralled. It was really wonderful.”</p><p id=par-10_39>The album and song swept every category they had been nominated in at the Grammys in 1992. “I thank my dad for leaving me such a wonderful, wonderful heritage,” <a href=#>Natalie Cole said</a> at Radio City Music Hall that year.</p><p id=par-11_23>The album and song <a href=#>made it to No. 1 </a>on the Billboard charts in 1991, but it was Natalie’s accomplishment, not her father’s.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>His most famous song remains popular today</h2><p id=par-12_36>Cole’s most famous song? It’s “The Christmas Song” recorded by Nat King Cole in 1953. Written by Mel Torme specifically for Cole, <a href=#>the holiday tune</a> is wildly popular, naturally, between November and December each year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-74258190.jpg><p id=par-13_35>With its imagery of warm chestnuts and children waiting for Santa Claus to make his annual visit, Cole’s recording of “The Christmas Song” <a href=#>catapulted the singer </a>back into the top 5 on Billboard in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZq6aq12jrrV5yqKloGWTpLmmv4ympqysXZuurrvUrGSsp56ce6nAzKVm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
