I am not sure if it’s because I missed it so much or if I am anxious to try replicating everything I ate on vacation. Maybe it’s a little of both. But one thing is for sure….I LOVE to create recipes and I LOVE a challenge. &nbsp;It’s what I am passionate about! I want to do study, do my detective work, and figure out how to create copycat recipes.</p><p>Months ago, my amazing sister-in-law told me about these popular protein cookies that she couldn’t get enough of. She has been on a macro diet for months now and I covet her biceps and calves every single day. She looks incredible! Since I am such a cookie fanatic, I had to try these cookies. Within about 2 minutes of devouring one, I decided that I needed to figure out how to make them because everyone wants a cookie with less guilt!</p><p>If you know anything about me, I have zero fear in the kitchen. I will try anything and everything so I went to the store, bought some Lenny and Larry’s cookies, and went to town. &nbsp;After several batches and tweaks here and there, I came up with the Lenny and Larry’s Protein Cookie Copycat. And honestly…I can eat these all day long!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC_0580ed2-copy.jpg alt="Lenny and Larry's Protein Cookie Copycat by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com 16 grams of protein per cookie " width=4215 height=2971 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Here’s the thing about these cookies…..</p><p>They promise 16 grams of protein per cookie.

It’s important to use it cold, straight out of the refrigerator so that the cookies don’t spread too much. If you aren’t worried about keeping them vegan, you can substitute butter.</li><li>There are no eggs in these cookies. We use ground flax seeds and water to mimic an egg. I also tried <strong><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B00AQFGL3O data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>chia seeds</a></strong> (because I am crazy like that) and they worked well. They were a little more noticeable in the cookies but still worked similar to an egg. You can use either flaxseeds or chia seeds. Let the seeds sit in water for 1-2 minutes to soften before adding to bowl.</li><li>I experimented using both Vanilla Pea Protein Powder and <strong><a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B000GISTZ4 data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Vanilla Whey Protein Powder</a></strong>. There was a big difference between the two. The pea protein created a sturdier cookie but the protein powder taste was much more pronounced than the vanilla whey powder. My kids could recognize the taste difference between the pea protein and whey protein. The whey protein worked similar to when I use nonfat powdered milk in my baked goods. &nbsp;The whey protein powder cookie did end up to be slightly flatter but the taste was better, in my opinion. If you want to keep the cookies vegan, then pea protein is your best bet. I would recommend using pea protein brown rice protein powder blend for my vegan friends. For my non-vegan friends, I would suggest using vanilla whey protein.</li><li>Use<strong> <a class=easyazon-link data-cart=y data-cloak=y data-identifier=B0043348LW data-locale=US data-localize=y data-popups=y data-tag=modehone-20 href=# rel=nofollow>Whole Wheat Pastry flour</a></strong>. Pastry flour is finer and creates a more tender cookie. You can substitute white pastry flour as well.</li><li>There are dairy free chocolate chip options available that taste really incredible. I used Enjoy Life Chocolate Chunks. If you aren’t worried about keeping the cookies vegan, then you can use semi-sweet or dark chocolate chunks.</li><li>Flatten the dough before putting in the oven. I tried putting them in the oven, rolled tightly in a ball, and they stayed in a ball. These are meant to be large cookies and need to spread some in the oven.</li><li>There are 16 grams of protein per cookie. These are very large cookies and are actually considered 2 servings, according to Lenny and Larry. But heck you do whatever you please and eat the entire cookie!</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC_0609ed-copy.jpg alt="Lenny and Larry's Protein Cookie Copycat by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com l 16 grams of protein per cookie " width=4091 height=3033 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>These two photos are the cookies using Vanilla Whey Protein Powder. The cookies spread more, had more crackling to them, but had a better flavor. I didn’t notice the protein powder flavor in these as much as the Pea Protein Powder.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC_0605ed.jpg alt="Lenny and Larry's Protein Cookie Copycat by Modern Honey l www.modernhoney.com l 16 grams of protein per cookie" width=4038 height=2622 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=2635 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/lenny-larrys-protein-cookie-copycat/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=9.5><li id=wprm-recipe-12493-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=-1><p>Preheat oven to 370 degrees.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12493-step-0-1 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=1><p>In large mixing bowl, cream together margarine and sugar until creamy, about 2 minutes.</p></li><li id=wprm-recipe-12493-step-0-2 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=1><p>In small bowl, mix together ground flax seed or chia seeds and water.
