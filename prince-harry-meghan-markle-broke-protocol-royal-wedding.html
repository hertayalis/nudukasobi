The ceremony was expected to break some rules and traditions, but the royal couple broke one rule various times throughout the wedding that many may not know about.

While it seems like a small thing that they've done in public before, even when they were just dating, it's still a pretty big deal for since other members of the royal family follow this rule pretty closely.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prince William and Kate Middleton are known for following royal protocol and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/g20651504/royal-family-rules-etiquette/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="not showing public displays of affection" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">not showing public displays of affection</a>. Even before the wedding, Prince Harry and Markle have been more open about displaying their relationship and have held hands multiple times, even while on royal assignments.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even though they broke protocol, it's likely that they won't receive any backlash from the Queen or the Palace since it's their wedding day. Also, since Meghan was technically not part of the royal family at the time, she can get away with a little rule breaking during the ceremony.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's likely that their PDA won't change though, even if Markle is now part of the royal family. Since Prince Harry is only sixth in line to the throne, he is <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a12804244/prince-harry-meghan-markle-can-hold-hands-duke-duchess-cambridge-cant/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="allowed a little more freedom" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">allowed a little more freedom</a> than his older brother. They might be a royal couple now, but this it's likely that this won't be the last time they'll hold hands in public and let's hope it never ends.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for 12 of the sweetest moments from the royal wedding" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/sequence-06-00-00-02-03-still001-1526739745.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ebc9841a-f2a6-4043-85a9-243348d2098a_1649694247.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tamara Fuentes" title="Headshot of Tamara Fuentes" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p><a href=#>Tamara Fuentes</a> is the current Entertainment Editor at Cosmopolitan, where she covers TV, movies, books, celebrities, and more.
