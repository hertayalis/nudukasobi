He wrote, ‚ÄúGreat man. Funny as hell. Such a nice person. Love to Bob and his whole family.‚Äù He also maintains a presence on his official Instagram account, which has over 11.9 million followers. The actor was also in the spotlight lately when two of his older films, 'The Longest Yard' and 'Just Go With It', were among Netflix's top ten most viewed films.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, we have seen celebrities being frequently targeted by these kinds of hoaxes. In 2009, it was reported that Jeff Goldblum had died after jumping over a cliff in New Zealand. Fans of the 63-year-old Jurassic Park actor hurried to express their sympathies, only to find out that the announcement was a terrible prank.&nbsp;</p><p>In similar rumors, in 2011 it was claimed that Dwayne Johnson had fallen off a mountain. He retaliated on Twitter saying, "I would love to meet the person who is starting rumors of my death ‚Äî to show them how a dead foot feels up their a**.‚Äù In 2012, pranksters started the 'RIP Morgan Freeman' Facebook page. The 79-year-old actor took to Facebook to put an end to the rumors, writing, "Like Mark Twain, I keep reading that I have died. I hope those stories are not true... But if they are, I'm happy to report that my afterlife seems identical to my life when I was alive."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooaNirqWtzGaqmqaUobKzecOemJ1lpJ64bsDOpGSpp6OpeqS4wKKkoqaXYq6kwM6rZJ2qn6y7prCMppiknV2brq%2B%2FjKmYp6GT</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
