"Our partnership has really come into focus about what we do for each other and how we deal with our family," Costner shared, adding, "Our house is like a river: You've just got to get into the flow of it. And whatever you thought it was going to be, maybe it still can, but it's going to have to work with what the day brings."</p><p>During quarantine, Costner also shared how breakfast was "the one meal I can handle," while Baumgartner was in charge of homeschooling their kids. "I'm computer illiterate. I'm so thankful for Christine as a partner. Because they would look at me ... and I wouldn't be that guy. And I want to be that guy for the people that love me."<strong><br></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGhpbIVxe9ahpmaho2K4psLIp2Scp6Opu6a%2B0mauop6VYrCpvsisq6KmlWKvosHMoJirrJ6av3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
