While sat in the witness box, the judge finally reveals the truth of the situation to him, explaining: "As I said weeks ago when you first entered this courtroom, this is my last trial of my career, what I didn't tell you is that it's also the first because I'm not a real judge, you're not a real foreperson, this is not a real case.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Ronald disses Sonic in Jury Duty</figure><p id=eSM0Hyt9klx data-wc=62>Confused, Ronald replied: "What?!" before the episode ends. In the finale, the judge continues to explain the situation to the only non-actor on the show, saying: "Your fellow jurors, as well as the defendant, the plaintive, bailiff Nicky, myself, we're all actors. Everything you saw was carefully planned. What I'm saying is, it was all fake except for one important element, you!</p><p id=etsvcXAWXnr data-wc=32>"You see Ronald, even though the case… wasn't real. There was most definitely a trial held inside this courtroom. You were presented day after day with countless challenges, responsibilities and ethical dilemmas."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27d5e3608802-jurydutynew.jpg><p id=e7H5THvjFiE data-wc=69>Listing some of the challenges posed to poor Ronald, he continued: "You knew Mr Marsden caused the sequester with his paparazzi stunt, yet you never told a soul. We put you in an adjoining room with Todd with his odd demeanour and obsession with body parts where specifically intended to frighten, but you didn't shut him out, you welcomed him into your room and into your non-optimally designed heart.</p><p id=euU1TXOe2ac data-wc=62>"You refused Ken's $2000 even though you beat him at Newt… you took the blame for James Marsden's giant [expletive]. Ronald, the list goes on and on. We've considered all of the evidence presented at your trial, and we've decided, Ronald Gladden, that you're a hero. In recognition of your service, of your kindness and strength of character, I reward you $100,000."</p><p id=e16lRu-bP-n data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Jury Duty: James Marsden reveals real reaction to Ronald dissing movie</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ezMdhcV3sTN data-wc=14><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Jury Duty cast: Who are they and where have you seen them before?</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=epHjwt-aeVM data-wc=20>Shocked, Ronald replied: "What?!

What!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5869dab32601-screenshot-2023-04-13-at-115851.png><p id=eCFwWiK96z5 data-wc=28>Greeting his fellow jurors, who he had made friends with over the past few weeks, he continued to show his total shock, saying: "Are you kidding? Lonny too?!"</p><p id=e3hDDGmt-5Y data-wc=50>He then told the camera: "It doesn't feel real, it really doesn't. I thought it was a joke at first and then everything kept happening – so I don't know! […] I like to think that I pick up on things and am pretty intuitive, but they all fooled me." &nbsp;</p><p id=euiehAYPlkv data-wc=37>The final moments of the finale revealed that Ronald is still friends with the cast of actors, and showed snaps of Ronald hanging out with several of his fellow jurors, including enjoying a drink with James Marsden.</p><p id=eANfyZJxzg data-wc=26></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
