Darcey begins to question whether Georgi is in the relationship for the right reasons. Eventually Georgi seeks out Jesse Meester to chat with him about his relationship with Darcey.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_68>“I don’t really still know too much about it to this day, I’ll be watching it along with you guys. But what I first felt was a low blow. It was a slap in the face. I think they both just wanted each other’s attention for some reason, and that it was a manipulation move on both their parts,” Silva told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> of Rusev’s conversation with Meester.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_48>“[T]here are other people he could have talked to. My ex-husband who’s the father of my daughters, my dad, Florian — another male who would know much more about me. Not that kid. Whatever was said, whether it was good, bad, ugly, nonsense, sweet, BS…it’s BS,” she added.</p><p id=par-5_43>It remains to be seen what advice Jesse Meester might have for Georgi Rusev. Meester and Silva did not end their relationship on good terms, and it’s clear that they both maintain a chip on their shoulder when it comes to the other.</p><h2 id=h-she-chats-with-georgi-rusev-s-ex>She chats with Georgi Rusev’s ex</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_34>It seems as if Darcey Silva sought out Georgi Rusev’s ex-wife for a conversation on Darcey & Stacey before he reached out to Jesse Meester. She says it’s not the same thing at all.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_47>“I can’t really compare it to me meeting Georgi’s ex, because that’s someone he was married to, he was a stepdad to her daughter, I needed to know some things that I thought were going to be confirmed if I met with her,” she told Entertainment Weekly.</p><p id=par-8_16>When the two finally met up for a chat, Darcey Silva was in for a surprise.</p><p id=par-9_52>“There was one time I was on his computer. Like a sugar mama’s website popped up,” Georgi’s ex-wife revealed. This follows on Silva finding a sock full of cash in Goergi’s drawers, as well as Stacey Silva claiming that Georgi Rusev has become more entitled when it comes to asking for gifts.</p><p id=par-10_24>“You’re acting like you don’t trust me. You believe more my ex and your friends than me,” Georgi told Darcey after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she confronted him</a>.</p><h2 id=h-darcey-silva-teases-a-rocky-road-ahead>Darcey Silva teases a rocky road ahead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/darceysilvastaceysilva1.jpg><p id=par-11_47>Will Georgi Rusev and Darcey Silva stay together at the end of Darcey & Stacey Season 2? Darcey has remained coy about it all, as she’s surely required to under a contract with TLC. However, she says in the end, she’s staying true to what she wants.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_40>“And you’ll see where Georgi and I end up. Whether we’re together or not, it doesn’t matter. It starts from within. I just wanted to be the strongest person I can for myself and my daughters,” she told Entertainment Weekly.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_30>What’s more, she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a> that she felt no pressure to force things to work with Georgi, as she’d rather be with the right person than force a marriage.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_20>“No, because I just want to be with the right person. And however long it takes, it takes,” she explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxor7CnrBmq6SWsKbFjJ2Yq5uVrnq0tcuvmGabkaG5tHnGnqarn5liv7a%2FxK%2BqZpuYlsFuw8itn2ailajApnnMnpysrJWneqJ50qWYqWWZo3q1tMRmnZqblWO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
