"He invited all of the showgirls back to his hotel room," she told <a href=#>The Huffington Post</a>, declaring that the King "instantly glommed on to" her. Presley was supposedly in the midst of a <a href=#>divorce</a> at the time, but despite his attention and availability, Peterson claims not much happened. "You have to remember, I was underage. So nothing did go on, except some kissing," she said. Peterson says she and Presley talked all night and into the next day. He even gave her some advice that jump-started her career.&nbsp;"He said, 'If you really want to be in showbiz, you've got to get out of this town,'" she recalled. He also suggested voiced lessons, because by 25, she'd "be too old to dance." The next day, Peterson says she got a vocal coach, and a month later, she was singing in her stage show.</p><p>Though she didn't get it on with Presley, Peterson did lose her virginity to another male singer during her Las Vegas days: Tom Jones. In 2008, she told Blender (via <a href=#>Dlisted</a>) that Jones "seemed gentlemanly and nice, so when he was jumping on me, I thought, 'Well, if I'm ever gonna do this, it might as well be with Tom Jones.'" Unfortunately, the experience was "horrible" for, um, anatomical reasons we won't get into here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtmZoB5e9ahmK1llaHDqr7AZqSiq6SnsrS%2FjKidZqyYmnqlrdGkZKWnn6DAbrjIpJxmrJ%2BZrrp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
