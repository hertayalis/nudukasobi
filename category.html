Zoodles seem to be all the rage, but have you tried “doodles”? Doodles (that’s what I’m calling them) are noodles made out of daikon and they’re awesome. They’ve got a little bit more bite to them than zucchini noodles and I find them to be less watery.&nbsp;I love how they look like rice noodles, yet these noodles are all vegetable. To go along with the daikon noodles, I made these bowls with cucumber, carrots, radishes, tofu and fresh herbs.

He grew up in Florida, so I always envisioned him growing up among kiwi trees.&nbsp;His grandfather had quite the green thumb, and Jack always tells stories of the fruits and vegetables they would pick and eat together. He talks about kiwi so much that I had just assumed that this tropical fruit was part of that picture as well. Last week when I was trying to dream up a unique salsa recipe, I thought kiwi would be fun and different, and most importantly – Jack would love it. It’s not a fruit I typically…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This cauliflower rice burrito bowl delivers all the best parts of a Chipotle burrito bowl – fajita veggies, cilantro lime flavor, plenty of black beans and avocado – and skips the worst part (aka the food coma that comes when you’re done). To make it lighter, I swap seasoned cauliflower rice for regular rice. Then, instead of piling it with cheese or sour cream, I finish it with a creamy cashew green chile sauce. The combination is light, bright, and downright fun. I can’t get enough of it!

I was craving a cookie, but I didn’t have the exact ingredients for my oatmeal cookie recipe on hand. I messed around with it, swapping in what I did have, and I ended up with a sweet and nutty “dough” made from oats and almond butter. It was never going to bake into perfect oatmeal cookies, but it tasted so good that I immediately thought, “Energy bites!” A few tests later, and these oatmeal energy balls have become my favorite healthy snack. They’re rich, nutty, and chewy, and…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Let’s cut to the chase – I love root beer floats. Oh, by the way, this is Jack posting once again. That’s not to say that Jeanine doesn’t love root beer floats, but when we got an opportunity to work with a&nbsp;beer company that brews alcoholic root beer, I knew I would be writing this post. The first question I had, of course, was “boozy root beer? Is it good?” Well I’m glad to say that yes, BEST DAMN Brewing Co.’s&nbsp;hard root beer is really&nbsp;good and tastes just like root beer. Root beer floats may be one of my favorite…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Last spring, my mom visited for&nbsp;over a month to help with the book and one of&nbsp;her tasks was Designated Artichoke Cleaner. I love artichokes, but trimming them is kind of a hassle. Unfortunately, my mom does not live&nbsp;an&nbsp;artichoke cleaning’s distance away. Last weekend when I brought these&nbsp;artichokes home, I thought&nbsp;about re-assigning&nbsp;this task to Jack&nbsp;(he is the risotto stirrer and the pomegranate seed picker, among other useful things). But&nbsp;I&nbsp;decided to go for it myself, like a big girl, and it really wasn’t so bad. If you’re psyching yourself out of artichokes this spring – don’t! They take a little time, but…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Is it Saturday yet? I’ve been on the biggest breakfast kick and lately fruit-filled smoothies, muffins, and waffles are all I’ve been able to think about.&nbsp;I just finished eating a&nbsp;blueberry version of&nbsp;these muffins and now I’m sitting here daydreaming about what I might bake up&nbsp;this weekend. Since sweet breakfasts can get unhealthy really quickly, I’ve rounded up some of my favorite lighter morning treats.

For over a year, I was on a&nbsp;nonstop savory & spicy breakfast kick. Next came the carrot-ey baked goods, and now we’re onto these vegan scones. Or I should say, the royal&nbsp;“we” are on to these scones. Jack loves them too, but my dirty secret is that he only has one or two out of every batch because I hide the extras in the freezer – where I know he will never look (well, until he reads this).

Actually, I take that back. I probably love tortillas&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;the average person, but today I’m ditching them to wrap&nbsp;taco-like things with green wraps instead. This lightened-up “taco” recipe is inspired by these gorgeous collard greens&nbsp;that were in my Farmhouse box a little while ago. How pretty are they?? Along with local oranges, a chunk of red cabbage, a few limes, and an avocado, these wraps became a brighter, healthier&nbsp;version of fish tacos. The collard greens make delicious wrappers, but the key is to blanch them a little bit first. By dipping them…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>It’s springtime, and one of my favorite veggies is in peak season – the humble carrot. I love them in soups, in tacos, in cake (see here or here for a vegan version)… and right now they’re my favorite vegetable to eat for breakfast. Currently, I’m alternating between carrot cookies and these waffles that are&nbsp;–&nbsp;you guessed it – in the new cookbook! This is one of my favorite recipes, (and also one of my favorite photos from the book – how sweet is&nbsp;this little breakfast scene that Jenn set up!?)

Soon after that, I tried turning that soup into this tagliatelle recipe. We loved it so much that it made it into our first cookbook. So thanks, Rachel! Here it is, hope it was worth the wait! Weeknight Tagliatelle The soup that inspired this pasta is a simple, clean-out-the-fridge sort of recipe.
