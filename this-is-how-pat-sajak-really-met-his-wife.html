He met Lesly Brown shortly thereafter, in 1988 at a sports bar in California, according to <a href=#>People</a>. Brown, a graduate of the University of Maryland, had previously posed for "Playboy" in the issue called "Women of Washington," according to <a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a>. So, she wasn't nearly as famous as Sajak, but she had her own moment of fame. When Brown asked Sajak if he'd consider marriage again, the "Wheel of Fortune" host said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no!" Sheesh, Sajak!</p><p dir=ltr>To make matters even less romantic, Sajak later told People that things didn't really gel when he first met Brown. "There was no electricity in the air," Sajak said of meeting her. He then spoke to her, and added, "The subject of you didn't come up in my car ride home." Okay, man, don't kill us with romance! But all was not lost.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlibIV4f46tn6KrXZ7AbrTOsGSpmaRiwKK2wKRkq52Robm6ecyeq2agmah6uLXFnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
