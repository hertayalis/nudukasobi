That was the best decision of my life and I think I've hit my 40s in much better shape than I hit my 30s."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ25xYGx8pr%2FCmqeeZaSkerW0xGaaqK2eqb%2B6ecyenK1lkaG2tMDAoqlmmaCluabAzqeqZqClqK%2BiusNmm5qmmZq5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
