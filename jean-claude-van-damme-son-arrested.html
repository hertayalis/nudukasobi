The actor has been married five times to four different women, and has two children, Kristopher and Bianca, with Gladys Portugues, while Nicholas is his only son with his third wife, Darcy LaPier, who he married in 1994. Nicholas appears in his dad's 2018 film, while Bianca is also an actress, and opened up about her upbringing, telling : "My parents let us do our own thing. When I was young, my mum pushed me into martial arts for self-discipline. I was seven and like, 'I can't stand it'. I stuck with ballet and [ice] skating. As a teenager, I was so focused on speed skating, I wanted to be in the Olympics." Speaking about her father, she added: "It's complicated. I always have people coming up and telling me how much they love my dad. It's nice to hear, but it's like, what does that have to do with me?"</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
