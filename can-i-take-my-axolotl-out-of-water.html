In fact, most of their body is made of cartilage rather than bone. That means they should not be handled unless absolutely necessary. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on thesprucepets.com</a><h2>Why do axolotls have to stay in water?</h2>Axolotls have to use their gills to breathe, which makes it hard for them to live on land. Instead of getting lungs during metamorphosis like frogs do, axolotls keep their gills as adults. Axolotls can't get enough oxygen from the air with these gills, so they can't stay out of the water for long amounts of time. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on smorescience.com</a><h2>Do axolotls need to come up for air?</h2>Whilst axolotls do get nearly all their oxygen requirements from the water using their external feather gills, they do also have lungs. Axolotls will sometimes be observed swimming to the surface for a gulp of air. This is perfectly normal behaviour on the odd occasion. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on ntlabs.co.uk</a><h2>Do axolotls need access to land?</h2>Axolotls are a type of salamander. Salamanders are amphibians, they usually have gills in the first part of their lives when they live in water, but after undergoing metamorphosis, develop lungs so that they can live on land. However, axolotls don't make this transition, they live in the water all their lives. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on plantasiaswansea.co.uk</a><h2>I Bought 100's Of AXOLOTLS For My AQUARIUM!</h2><h2>Why are axolotls illegal to own in some states?</h2>Axolotls are native to Mexico and are considered an endangered species in the wild. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) was working to protect native wildlife by regulating the import and sale of certain non-native species, including axolotls. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What states don't allow axolotls?</h2>As many have noticed, axolotls are illegal to own as pets in some US states and Canadian provinces, as well as other parts of the world.

The best way to avoid this is by fitting a spray bar or flow-spreading outlet. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on allanspetcenter.com</a><h2>Do axolotls like to be touched?</h2>Be gentle when handling them, and avoid putting too much pressure on any part of their body. Keep handling to a minimum – As discussed earlier, axolotls do not enjoy being handled or touched. Limit handling only when necessary, such as during tank cleaning or when relocating them to a different tank. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on theaquariumlife.com</a><h2>How hard is it to take care of an axolotl?</h2>Specialized care requirements: Axolotls have specific care needs that can be challenging for beginners. They require a coldwater aquarium (around 60-68°F or 15-20°C), and maintaining the appropriate water temperature can be expensive and complicated. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Do axolotls recognize their owners?</h2>Axolotls are known for their ability to recognize their owners and respond to them in various ways. While they may not have the same type of recognition as mammals, they can become familiar with their owners' presence and behaviors. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Do axolotls do better in pairs?</h2>Axolotls are not a social species, so they don't need a friend to be entertained. That being said, it is perfectly ok to house axolotls together, as long as they are roughly the same size. If one axolotl easily fits into the other's mouth, chances are it will end up as a snack. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on watercritters.ca</a><h2>How deep should axolotl water be?</h2>At the minimum, the water depth should be a little more than the axolotl's length. However, adding in additional depth would assist with water quality & endow animals with adequate room to freely move. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on fishlab.com</a><h2>Can I put an axolotl with fish?</h2>They have specific care requirements and can be sensitive to water conditions and tankmates. Fish can pose a risk to axolotls due to their potential to nibble on their gills or fins, which can cause harm. It's generally recommended to avoid keeping fish with axolotls to prevent any stress or harm to either species. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Are axolotls okay with fish?</h2>It may be tempting to buy an axolotl and put them in an existing fish tank, but most other aquatic creatures can not cohabitate safely with axolotls. Axolotls will try to eat anything that will fit in their mouths—including other axolotls! Any smaller fish in the aquarium will become food sooner or later. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on pethelpful.com</a><h2>Do axolotls make noises?</h2>No, axolotls can't talk. Despite the popularity of videos showing these quirky amphibians appearing to bark, axolotls don't actually have any vocal cords. That doesn't seem to stop them though – they can instead create noises through muscle contractions and by gulping air from the surface of the water. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on iflscience.com</a><h2>Do axolotl bites hurt?</h2>Axolotl bites don't hurt at all. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on caudata.org</a><h2>Can axolotls see you?</h2>Axolotls actually have very poor eyesight. They rely on their excellent sense of smell to help them find their food. In the wild, they can be found in the dark muddy bottom of Lake Xochimilco, so they prefer habitats with less light in order to heighten their other senses. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on visitseaquest.com</a><h2>What do axolotls love the most?</h2>They Are Carnivorous<p>Axolotls are carnivorous—they eat everything from fish and worms to insects and crustaceans.

A standard aquarium light to provide a day/night cycle will suffice, although they don't tend to like too much bright light, so it is best to keep it on a lower setting. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on reptiles.swelluk.com</a><h2>What do axolotls love in their tank?</h2>Sand of any color that is safe for axolotls will be suitable, but it is best to have a bare bottom tank for baby axolotls, as they might accidentally ingest substrate. Rocks (as big as the axolotl's head), fake plants, or plastic caves are a few examples of decorations you can plant in your axolotl tank. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on wikihow.com</a><h2>Can axolotls bite?</h2>Axolotls are capable of biting food items and giving any neighboring tank fellows a nip if they get too close.
