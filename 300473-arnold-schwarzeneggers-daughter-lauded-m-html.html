First as a happy family, then as a family of divorce, and then as a blended family who still spends much of their time together.</p><p class=Zg>Now, they have made headlines once again because of Katherine Schwarzenegger. She recently posted an Instagram video that instantly garnered positive comments from her followers after her husband was slammed for doing the same.</p><p class=Zg>Katherine took to Instagram to share a video of herself all dressed up and said that although she looked great, she would still be going to bed by 8 p.m. She insinuated that the reason was her teething baby.</p><p class=Zg>Fans flooded the post's comments section with positive and loving comments, talking about what a wonderful woman she is. One fan <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cnx1uHapAjl/?hl=en">called</a> Katherine a "stunner," while another said she was "drop-dead gorgeous."</p><p class=Zg>While others talked primarily about her looks and praised her for looking so great with two young children, one fan spoke about Katherine's spirit. The fan <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cnx1uHapAjl/?hl=en">commented</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"You have the kindest heart, Katherine. Thank you for always spreading love and positive vibes."</p><p class=Zg>Katherine welcomed her second child with her husband, <a class="zd d" href=#>Chris Pratt</a>, on May 21 last year. Pratt <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd4bNQOpO11/>announced</a> their daughter, Eloise's birth on Instagram. The couple also has an older daughter, Lyla.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>How Did Katherine Meet Her Husband Who Was A Divorcee?</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>Chris Pratt, who was previously married to actress Anna Faris for eight years, started dating Katherine in 2018, a year after Pratt announced he was separating from Faris. They had something of a whirlwind romance and were married in 2019.</p><p class=Zg><a class="zd d" href=#>Pratt</a> has talked about the beginning of his romance with Katherine and said it was a happy twist of fate that he and Katherine met. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/chris-pratt-katherine-schwarzenegger-relationship-timeline-photos/>admitted</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"We met at church. It was a lot of kismet and a lot of connections, but that was where we met."</p><p class=Zg>Since their wedding, Pratt has often gushed about how lucky he is to have met and married his love after coming out of a divorce. He mentioned that he had been blessed in his marriage.</p><p class=Zg>They have been together for a few years, and fans have begun to ask what is keeping their bond so strong. The couple often exhibits a true love for one another in public, which charms their fans.</p><p class=Zg>When asked what it was that had kept his bond with his wife so solid and loving, Pratt put it down to one thing. He <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/chris-pratt-katherine-schwarzenegger-relationship-timeline-photos/>said</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"I got married last June, and just communication constantly is, like, really the most amazing gift you can have, I think, in a partnership and in a relationship. … I don't like to go to bed angry. And we both are the same way."</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>Why Was Pratt Slammed for Praising Katherine?</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>While fans commented lovely things on Katherine's recent Instagram post, <a class="zd d" href=#>Pratt</a> was once slammed for doing the same thing for his wife on his own account. In November 2021, he shared a photo of him smiling at the camera and Katherine gazing lovingly at him.</p><p class=Zg>In the caption of the post, he praised Katherine for being a wonderful woman and a great mother to their daughter. However, fans were upset when Pratt <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CVynGLRp_ju/>said</a> Katherine had given him a "healthy daughter."</p><p class=Zg>Pratt and his ex-wife, Anna Faris, share a son named Jack, who suffered from bleeding on the brain as an infant. He has since suffered many health issues, and his parents were told he might also suffer developmental delays.</p><p class=Zg>When Pratt said his wife had given him a healthy daughter, fans were enraged and said his son didn't need him. Other fans wondered if it was necessary for him to mention that his daughter with Katherine was healthy and said he was a terrible father.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A comment left under Chris Pratt's Instagram post | Source: instagram.com/prattprattpratt</p><p class="Zg _g">Another fan said he had disrespected his son by mentioning that his daughter was healthy. This fan ended their comment by saying, "shame on you. There were many other similar comments on the post.</p><p class=Zg>More than a year later, Pratt finally commented on the backlash he received from the post. He mentioned that the comments bothered him. He said he was worried his son would one day read the words because they are online forever.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>A comment left on Chris Pratt's Instagram post | Source: instagram.com/prattprattpratt</p><p class=Zg>Pratt was saddened by the incident. Sharing his feelings on the comments he received and how they affected him and his family, Pratt <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2022-06-28/chris-pratt-katherine-schwarzenegger-instagram-post-mens-health>confessed</a>:</p><p class=Zg>"I cried about it. I hate that these blessings in my life are — to the people close to me — a real burden."</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Chris Pratt and son Jack Pratt attend the ceremony honoring Chris Pratt with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 21, 2017 in Hollywood, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Pratt said all he was trying to do was share the excellent relationship he has with his current wife and never intended to disrespect his ex-wife or the son he shares with her as he loves his son very much.</p><p><h2 class=ch><strong class=Xg>What Relationship Does Pratt Have with His Son?</strong></h2></p><p class=Zg>Last December, fans caught a glimpse into just how close Pratt and his son are. Pratt posted a <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CmVJa_mp9Xo/>photo</a> of his son on Instagram looking at two elves. He said the elves were back for the fourth year in a row, and he would blame them if anything went missing.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Chris Pratt, ex-wife Anna Faris and son Jack Pratt attend the ceremony honoring Chris Pratt with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 21, 2017 in Hollywood, California | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>Unlike his post about Katherine, this post garnered sweet comments from his fans. Another post Pratt shared showed that his son had left a note for him in his dressing room on set that said he would see him later.</p><p class=Zg>Jack signed the note with a heart, and fans realized that the father and son were closer than they thought when Pratt posted the photo of Katherine in 2021. They share a sweet bond, as does Pratt with his daughters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnaWxnaHqivs2oo51lo5i1uK3Rs5ynnZecsrO%2FjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzecuarJ2dlGK6b7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
