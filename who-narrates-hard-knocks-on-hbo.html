The world of football is particularly popular in the United States, where fans of the National Football League’s many teams line up to enjoy the five-month season with incomparable zeal. Those with a particular fondness for the sport may even tune into HBO’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hard Knocks</a></strong> series, which documents the training and development of individual NFL teams in the lead-up to the official season. These days, it additionally follows the team through the regular NFL season, allowing viewers to catch a glimpse of the entire process — from training to hopeful victory.</p><p data-characters=700 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>The reality sports documentary series has been ongoing since 2001, and it’s as popular as ever. In 2021, it introduced the expanded look at the NFL, with an additional set of episodes — showcasing the regular NFL season — following the typical Hard Knocks episodes. Over the course of its tenure on HBO, the show has followed some of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL’s most popular teams</a> — like the Dallas Cowboys, Cleveland Browns, and Kansas City Chiefs — and every season, barring one, has featured the same narrator. This year, he’s set to guide viewers through the New York Jets’ training camp and pre-season prep, with the same skill he’s brought to nearly two dozen prior seasons.</p><h2 id=h-who-narrates-hard-knocks data-injectable=false>Who narrates Hard Knocks?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Its rare that a reality television host lasts through a show’s entire tenure, but — barring a single outlier — Hard Knocks has stayed faithful to its longtime narrator. <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Liev Schreiber</a></strong>, longtime actor and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deeply recognizable star</a>, has been a staple of the program since its very first season, and he remains its loyal narrator to this day.</p><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=false>Schreiber debuted with Hard Knocks‘ first season, all the way back in 2001, and he’s seen a single-season break since then. In 2007 — when the show was highlighting the Kansas City Chiefs — comedic icon and pop culture legend Paul Rudd stepped in to fill the role. As a passionate fan of the team, Rudd was overjoyed at the opportunity to narrate for a season, but he handed the reins back over to Schreiber at the end of the year. Since then, Schreiber’s been behind the wheel each and every season, as Hard Knocks follows America’s favorite teams from training to triumph.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMp5irqpGpsrR5x5qpnWWbo7ykt9JmpqdlmJe8cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
