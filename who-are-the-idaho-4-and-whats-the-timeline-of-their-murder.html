But although the media spotlight has been turned to him – as it often happens in homicide cases – he’s not the protagonist of this story. If anything, and if he’s in fact the killer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as the evidence seems to suggest</a>, he’s the villain who unjustifiably robbed these very young adults of the vital right to continue creating their own beautiful narratives, and their friends and family of seeing them unravel as they should have.</p><p data-characters=197 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>So, let’s bring the focus back to those who deserve it, for the fact that they lived and should’ve kept living if someone, an unfeeling monster, had not stolen that sacred right away from them.</p><h2 id=h-who-are-the-victims data-injectable=false><strong>Who are the victims?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Design-sem-nome-2023-12-01T163015.032.png><p data-characters=590 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Xana Kernodle, 20, from Avondale, Arizona, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">described by her older sister</a>, Jazzmin, as “one of the happiest, funniest people [she’s] ever met.” This is especially admirable taking into consideration the rocky start she had in regards to her family <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in her first years</a>. Due to their parents’ toxic patterns which included drug abuse, Xana and Jazzmin would end up being rehomed to live with her uncle and aunt. Despite the difficulties – perhaps in part because of them – Xana grew into someone who strived to manifest the positive energy she wished to be surrounded by.</p><p data-characters=518 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Ethan Chapin, 20, from Conway, Washington, is Xana’s boyfriend. He is one of 3 triplets – a girl, Maizie, and two boys, Ethan and Hunter – and he “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">loved</a> his siblings, boats, and working on a tulip farm.” Jazzmin Kernodle described him as “the sweetest kid ever.” Ethan’s family won’t be attending the trial as, according to what his mother <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told NBC’s TODAY</a>, they have trust in the prosecutors to do their work as the now family of 4 needs to focus on healing and being there for each other instead.</p><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>Maddie Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21 and from Idaho, were inseparable best friends, even in their last hours as they slept side by side on the same bed on the house’s third floor. The two met a decade ago <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2013 at Charter Academy</a> in the city of Coeur d’Alene in Kootenai County. They went with each other on family vacations and insisted on being enrolled at the same high school, Lake City High School.

At around 4 am, Xana got DoorDash and records show that at 4:12 she was active on TikTok. Around this time, the victims were all in their beds more than ready to call it a night.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>The first to be attacked were Maddie and Kaylee, in this order.
