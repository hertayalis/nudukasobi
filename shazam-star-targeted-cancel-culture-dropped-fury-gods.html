Then again, 42-year-old Michelle Borth is in the same demographic as Zachary Levi, Adam Brody, D.J. Cotrona and Meaghan Good, all of whom are aged between 39 and 41, while Borth was reported to have signed a multi-picture deal to recur across the entire shared universe.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>However, the star has now found herself targeted by cancel culture based on a social media post she made back in January that eulogized Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by a police officer during the riots in the Capitol.

Itâ€™s a strange situation for sure, but as of yet thereâ€™s been no official word as to why sheâ€™s been replaced in <strong>Shazam!
