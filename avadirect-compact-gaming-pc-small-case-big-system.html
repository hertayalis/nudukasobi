It's easy to build a powerful desktop if you take a big, beefy enclosure like SilverStone's FT-02 or the Thermaltake Level 10 GT and just fill it with the highest performance parts on the market, overclock them, and call it a day—and certainly we've seen our share of those. Taking all of that raw performance and shrinking it into a MicroATX case can be a little more difficult, though, especially when you're dissipating a cumulative TDP of at least 730 watts."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Taking all of that raw performance and shrinking it into a MicroATX case can be a little more difficult, though, especially when you're dissipating a cumulative TDP of at least 730 watts. Yet when we saw that AVADirect had produced another compact but incredibly high performance gaming desktop, we had to take a look. Gulftown may be on its way to bed soon with the advent of Sandy Bridge-E, but let's see if we can't give it one last hurrah in the process.</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4864/s-glamour.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>While this custom build isn't super compact, it's certainly a fair sight smaller than many of the gaming systems we've reviewed. It sure doesn't feel smaller when you carry it, though, and that may have something to do with the configuration.</p><table align=center border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=565><tbody readability=22.393867924528><tr readability=2><td align=center class=contentwhite colspan=2><strong>AVADirect Compact Gaming PC Specifications</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Chassis</strong></td><td>Lian Li PC-V354 Red</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i7-990X overclocked to 4.4GHz<br>(spec: 6x3.46GHz, 32nm, 12MB L3, Turbo to 3.73GHz, 130W)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Motherboard</strong></td><td>ASUS Rampage III Gene Motherboard with X58 and ICH10R chipset</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>3x4GB Kingston HyperX DDR3-1600 (expandable to 48GB)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>2x AMD Radeon HD 6990 4GB GDDR5<br>(GIGABYTE GV-R699D5-4GD-B, Radeon HD 6990)<br>(2x1536 stream processors, 830MHz/5GHz Core/RAM, 256-bit memory bus)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Hard Drive(s)</strong></td><td>Intel 510 250GB SATA 6Gbps SSD<br>Seagate Barracuda XT 2TB SATA 6Gbps HDD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Optical Drive(s)</strong></td><td>HL-DT-ST BD-RE</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Networking</strong></td><td>Intel 82567V-2 Gigabit Ethernet</td></tr><tr readability=5><td><strong>Audio</strong></td><td>VIA VT2020 HD Audio<br>Speaker, mic, line-in, and surround jacks for 7.1 sound<br>Optical out</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Front Side</strong></td><td>2x USB 2.0 (3.0 connected to 2.0 header)<br>Mic and headphone jacks<br>SD card reader<br>Optical drive</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Top</strong></td><td>-</td></tr><tr readability=6><td><strong>Back Side</strong></td><td>1x PS/2<br>7x USB 2.0<br>Optical out<br>6-pin FireWire<br>Gigabit ethernet<br>2x USB 3.0<br>Speaker, mic, line-in, and surround jacks for 7.1 sound<br>2x DVI-D<br>8x Mini-DisplayPort<br>Fan controllers</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Operating System</strong></td><td>Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dimensions</strong></td><td>9.65" x 13.6" x 16.54"</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>9.2 lbs (case only)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Extras</strong></td><td>Custom air cooling design<br>BD-RE<br>Overclocked CPU</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Warranty</strong></td><td>3-year limited parts and labor</td></tr><tr readability=3.5471698113208><td><strong>Pricing</strong></td><td>Starts at <a href=#>$1,334</a><br>Priced as configured: $4,983</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These days one of the big questions for boutiques, at least as far as I've heard, has really been this: "Gulftown or Sandy Bridge?" AnandTech readers are a fairly informed lot, so for them it's (almost) a no brainer: Sandy Bridge. So why is the AVADirect system we have in house Gulftown-based?&nbsp;The answer turns out to be a bit complicated.</p><p>I don't presume to speak for AVADirect or really any of the boutiques, but this is a question that I've fielded a couple of times, because it boils down to the two extra cores on Gulftown plus the X58's dual full 16x PCI Express 2.0 lanes. In print, both of these just look better to the average consumer than the "limitations" Sandy Bridge poses. You may be able to get an NF-200-equipped motherboard to at least checkbox the PCI Express limitation, but Sandy Bridge doesn't presently offer six executable cores. Even though virtually no games will take advantage of them (and in fact, generally speaking Sandy Bridge is the superior gaming CPU), it's still an important checkbox for the more-money-than-sense market.</p><p>As an aside, I do want to point out that while the Intel Core i7-2600K is preferable to the i7-990X in 90% of cases, there are the 10% of us that do video editing on our PCs. In those instances, the i7-990X's two additional cores can make a tremendous difference that Sandy Bridge needs a heavy overclock to make up.</p><p>For the rest of the system, I'll just say that I saw AVADirect sending a similar build out to other sites and had to bring the tiny monster in house for a review, if only to satisfy my own curiosity. In the process they gave me some options for how to configure it, and the only request I made was the CrossFired AMD Radeon HD 6990s. This is a configuration I just haven't had the opportunity to test yet, something I've rectified here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF5gpNomK%2BZlJ6%2Fpq%2FTZpqopaCWsLV5xpqkoqaXYr2kedKmmKWkXZiutLGMm6CgZaOuwLWxzA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
