He applied without further hesitation. Unfortunately, he wasn't sent a list of questions in advance — and it's unlikely that he would have expected the host to command him to elaborate on the nature and content of his romantic fantasies at great length.&nbsp;</p><p>During his appearance on the show, Amedure was pressured to share the most intimate aspects of his daydreams. One involved whipped cream and strawberries.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Because of his love for the restaurant and respect for Reid Ashton, founder of The Golden Mushroom, Geoffrey purchased The Golden Mushroom and recreated it into the Mushroom Cellar in the Fieger Law office building!

They hired high-profile legal attorney Geoffrey Fieger, who made a name in the business as the legal representative of Jack Kevorkian, a doctor advocating for euthanasia.&nbsp;</p><p>In the court, Geoffrey alleged that the show producers wanted to exploit other people's suffering for the sake of making money — and that their failure to set up to regulations preventing participants from engaging in acts of verbal or physical abuse was tantamount to the active promotion of the such.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, he also revealed that show host Jenny Jones failed to acquire Schmitz's permission to participate in a segment revolving around another man's explicit sexual fantasies — which was to be aired on national television.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Yahoo, he also claimed that the producers of the show "did everything except pull the trigger."&nbsp;</p><p>The Amedure family won the case.
