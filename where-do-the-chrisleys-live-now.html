Where do they live?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Todd first started to make money by flipping houses. He and his first wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teresa Terry</a>, would move into a house, fix it up, sell it, and move onto the next one.</p><p>"He liked real estate, that’s where he made all his money and that's what he did from the beginning," Teresa told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. "He'd find houses, some of the ones he found... dogs live in better places. He'd fix them up and make them amazing, and then it was onto the next house."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Todd and Julie Chrisley listed their mansion in Brentwood, Tenn., several times.</h2><p>In 2019, Todd and Julie purchased a 6-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion in Brentwood, Tenn for just under $3.4 million. The European-style villa already boasted a chef's kitchen, basketball court, swimming pool, and wine cellar, among other perks, but the stars went straight to work renovating the space. Two months later, the put the property <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back on the market for $4.75 million</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>However, this was one flip that didn't go as planned. The Chrisleys had a hard time selling the home, re-listing the property several times and lowering the asking price. Within a year, the mansion came off the market and, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor.com</a>, property records indicate that Julie still owns the home.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But as we know, selling the house wasn't the couple's only problem. In August 2019, two months after first listing the mansion, the Chrisleys were indicted on multiple counts of conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud, and tax evasion by a federal grand jury in Atlanta, Ga. Their accountant, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Peter Tarantino</a>, was indicted on tax-related offenses as well.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why are the Chrisleys renting a home?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Titbit</a>, the Chrisleys adopted a rather nomadic lifestyle for a time because they were desperately trying to maintain their privacy. At the moment, they're on house arrest and appear to still be in Tennessee but are not living in the Brentwood mansion. Have they pared down to prepare for a potential prison sentence?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>It makes sense that the guilty couple might be renting since selling off their assets is probably a necessity at this time. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulture</a>, Los Angeles criminal defense attorney Troy Slaten said, "If they’re continuing to do the show and if it appears to the court that they’re flaunting ill-gotten gains in some way, that’s not going to bode well for them."</p><p>It stands to reason that living in a mansion they own could be considered "flaunting" what they got via "ill-gotten gains," so it's renting for the Chrisleys!</p><p>Catch new episodes of Chrisley Knows Best every Thursday at 9 p.m. ET on USA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmm6hlpJ2ybq%2FHq6CspJWuwG64yK%2BcZqafrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
