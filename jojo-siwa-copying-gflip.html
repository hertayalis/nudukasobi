Source: TikTok/@itsjojosiwaThough a tatted JoJo Siwa wasn't necessarily on our 2024 bingo card, the former Dance Moms star took to social media recently to flaunt a sleeve of patchwork tattoos. Considering these weren't accumulated over a period of time but instead appeared basically overnight, plenty of others were also baffled by this supposed transformation."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Lots of people dress like their faves and JoJo is a big fan and friend of G Flip."</p><p>"I think JoJo looks up to G Flip and I [think] that's OK!!" another wrote.</p><p>Around the same time the videos with tattoos were being posted, JoJo also made a video parodying G Flip, suggesting the temporary ink may have been for the content alone. That said, it doesn't explain her decision to keep them for press interviews.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@grubcounty href=#>@grubcounty</a><p>For all the stans out there, I can‚Äôt respect someone that gets fake tats to look like someone they‚Äôre in love with ü§ê <a title=inkboxtattoo href=#>#inkboxtattoo</a> <a title=inkbox href=#>#inkbox</a> <a title=jojosiwa href=#>#jojosiwa</a> <a title=jojo href=#>#jojo</a> <a title=faketattoo href=#>#faketattoo</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Rose's Turn (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast" href=#>‚ô¨ Rose's Turn (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">JoJo Siwa's sleeve of tattoos appears to be fake.</h2><p>The patchwork tattoos quickly drew criticism online, but thankfully they are not all real. Though JoJo has a couple of tattoos, most of those on the sleeve appear to be temporary tattoos.</p><p>One of the posts that sparked speculation was made on Instagram at the end of February, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">captioned</a> "48HRs in Florida... There [are] four photos in this slide that I can‚Äôt wait for you to understand what‚Äôs happening in them. Give me a few and you‚Äôll know I promise. Any guesses?" Former Bachelorette contestant <a href=#>Tyler Cameron</a> is in multiple of these photos.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@accesshollywood href=#>@accesshollywood</a><p>World ü§ù JoJoSiwa‚Äôs future kids</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Access Hollywood" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Access Hollywood</a></figure><p>Around the same time, an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Access Hollywood</a> was also posted to the outlet's TikTok account, showing JoJo with the patchwork sleeve of tattoos. In it, she claimed to already have her <a href=#>future kids' names</a> tattooed on her.</p><p>"This one's dedicated to my baby girl one day, her name is Freddy. Then this is dedicated to twin boys, Eddy and Teddy," she said. "I want three babies. I have my sperm donor lined up."</p><p>Thankfully, in the comments of the Access Hollywood video, JoJo did clarify that the tattoos on her arm are not real ‚Äî but she did get a couple of new ones on her hands.</p><p>"Arm, no..." she commented in response to a question about the tattoos. "but just got two new real ones on my hands. Hopefully a reveal soon:)"</p><p>One of those slides in JoJo's Instagram post includes a video she also posted on TikTok which she claimed was the "biggest meeting of [her] life." Though we don't know what exactly JoJo has in the works just yet, it's possible it's nothing more than a collab with Gflip and that the temporary tattoos will be gone soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7yru4ysoLCZXZi8scXIp55mn5ahtrE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
