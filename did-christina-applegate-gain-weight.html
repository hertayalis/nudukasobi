The condition has the potential to cause permanent nerve damage or degeneration.</p><p style=color:#252525>During the ceremony, she was also seen barefoot. She explained on Twitter, sharing a photo of the same shoe, that “for some with Ms., the feeling of shoes may hurt or make us feel off balance.” “So I was me today.” Barefoot”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I have a very important ceremony coming up. This will be my first time out since diagnosed with MS. Walking sticks are now part of my new normal. Thank you <a href=# rel=noopener>@neowalksticks</a> for these beauties.
