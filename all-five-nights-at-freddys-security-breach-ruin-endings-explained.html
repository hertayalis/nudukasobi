From there, Gregory explains to his friend she “shouldn’t have entered the Pizzaplex” and that something in the sinkhole tricked her. Gregory says that he can’t let her escape and cuts the elevator line, with a trapped girl inside. During the credits, Roxy’s voice calls out Cassie’s name, hinting that she may be alive.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>This default ending is interesting and memorable due to how ambiguous it is. You don’t know whether Cassie is alive or not or even who was really talking to her in the end.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Scooper Ending</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Another ending that was featured in Ruin is known as the “Scooper ending.” Cassie runs towards the scooper room and closes the door before she gets caught by the mimic. After thinking that she’s safe, the mimic attacks the window, wearing a costume, but is then scooped by the machine, presumably killed in the process.</p><p data-characters=173 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>It is widely regarded as the best ending, as it is ambiguous enough to fit in with the rest and also leaves the door open for a number of other possibilities in the future.</p><h2 id=h-fazbear-ending data-injectable=false>Fazbear Ending</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>In this ending, Cassie learns that Gregory was never at the Pizzaplex and that she needs to escape. Unfortunately, when she puts on the mask, she is met with a scene that’s similar to one of the endings of Security Breach, with Gregory telling her that he’s found a place to hide. Many interpret this scene as Glitchtrap slowly infecting Cassie with the virus, and that she’s still trapped in the Pizzaplex.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>This ending is cool because it leaves you with tons of questions that keep you thinking about the game. Cassie’s fate is still up in the air with this one, which keeps players engaged in the franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZomKWkXZu2t7GMp6CgoKSoeqLAjJ%2BpnpyUrsBuv8ScrKuhpK56o77EmpqhZaKqtq95xKeboqaXqHqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
