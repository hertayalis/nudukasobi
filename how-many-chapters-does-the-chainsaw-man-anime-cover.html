The volumes are titled, Dog & Chainsaw, Chainsaw vs. Bat, Kill Denji, Gun is Mightier, and Minor. Overall, the anime has been well-received by fans and hasnâ€™t strayed too far from the source material. Itâ€™s a stylistic show that doesnâ€™t skirt around the bloodshed, but a scene involving Power was noticeably cut out from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainsaw Manâ€˜s post-credit scene</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=pt dir=ltr>Similar Motives. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gENYl6NLxk</a></p>â€” Chainsaw Man EN (@Chainsaw_EN) <a href=#>December 24, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>In the episode, Aki overcomes the Ghost Devil, which is being controlled by Akane.

Makima reports to the bureau and tells them about Gun Devilâ€™s contract with Akane and that she arranged the terrorist attack, but before she could be questioned about it, she was killed by the Snake Devil.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=tl dir=ltr>woof ðŸ—¿ wa ðŸ—¿ wah ðŸ—¿ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0RTJ2wBKOq</a></p>â€” Chainsaw Man EN (@Chainsaw_EN) <a href=#>December 28, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=415 data-current-count=715 data-injectable=true>The significant change takes place during the post-credit sequence. Both the anime and the manga show Denjiâ€™s dream where speaks to Pochita through a door and wants to pet him, but heâ€™s told never to open the door. The anime has a scene where Aki leaves Denji and Power who have passed out and goes to smoke a cigarette and a scene where someone asks Denji if heâ€™s a country mouse or a city mouse.</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=false>In the manga, Denji awakens after his dream and shouts, which wakes up Power. Power has grown new horns, and after Denji makes comments about them, Power punches him across the room. This surprises the two of them and signifies sheâ€™s gotten a power upgrade. This doesnâ€™t mean that they wonâ€™t include this storyline when the show comes back for season two. Itâ€™s likely that they didnâ€™t want to add in another storyline so they can fully explore Powerâ€™s character arc later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBlnZa7unnCoZiprJWnwG6wzp6qZqyYmnqktMCipayZp2K6orqMmqWipZVisLDCxKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
