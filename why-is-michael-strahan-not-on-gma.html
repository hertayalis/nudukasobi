The former NFL player famously left his high-rated gig on <a href=#>Live! with Kelly and Michael</a> to work at <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> full-time in 2016. In the years since, he became a staple on the popular morning series. But he has also taken a few significant breaks from the show.</p><p>So, why is Michael Strahan not on Good Morning America lately?

Indeed, Michael not only works on GMA and <a href=#>Fox NFL Sunday</a> (which film on opposite coasts), but he also hosts $The 100,000 Pyramid. The busy multihyphenate has own skincare line as well, in addition to a well-known apparel line. And in late 2022, he produced a podcast narrated by actress <a href=#>Kate Mara</a> called American Football.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Michael Strahan leave 'GMA'?</h2><p>It seems very unlikely he is leaving GMA permanently. Michael has a lot of irons in the fire, from his production company (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SMAC Entertainment</strong></a>) to his duties as an NFL announcer, but he seems to be a cracker jack at time management.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"People say, 'When do you sleep? Why do you work so much? You do Fox. You do GMA. You do The $100,000 Pyramid.' I love it though," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> back when his skincare line launched. "And I'm now at the point of where I don't have to do anything I don't enjoy. And if it gets to the point where I don't, then it'll be time to let that [thing] go. For now, every bit of it is fun."</p><p>We certainly hope that all is well for Michael and his family, and that he returns to our screens soon!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKahk52upriMrKurmZiWu266zq1kqKZdnLqi</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
