According to Ryan Beck on the page, the nurses and doctors have all remarked on how strong Kenny is, and they have also mentioned that although it is going to be a very long recovery, he is getting better every day. He is now in stable condition and is deeply sedated (at the time that this is being written). His medical staff is outstanding and responsive, and they are all very invested in his rehabilitation. He is in capable hands.</p><p>Loved ones are urged to consider donating, as funds will be used to help with Kenny’s medical bills and recovery.
