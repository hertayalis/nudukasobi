I didn't want them to have a relationship with food that was antagonistic or they felt like this was their enemy and that they were going to have to sort of like stake out a position with food,” she said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Sex and the City actress revealed that her home life growing up was not like that – instead of having all foods included in her home, she wasn't allowed to have any desserts. “And of course, all we did the minute we moved out was buy Entenmann’s cakes and cookies, and I didn't want that [for my kids]."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“In our house, we have cookies, we have cake, we have everything. And I think, as a result, you kind of have a healthier relationship," Parker continued. "My daughters will have the figures they have, and hopefully, they'll be healthy, and they’re athletes, and they enjoy food."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The enjoyment comes from a family-focused approach to food, too. Parker and Broderick — who also share a 21-year-old son, James — make it a point to have regular homemade meals as a unit. "We both cook every single day, every single day,” she said, later adding that "our children always...they always say like, ‘Wow, we're really lucky. We get to, we have dinner every night.'"<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqpmqBdn7K0v8icmGaokae4pr6MoZyapKSdxm6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mnainlGKxosHGoaueqqNihXd%2Bk2tpag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
