Starring Dean Cain as Clark Kent/Superman and Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane, the show ran for four season from 1993-1997 and provided fans with a much-needed dose of live-action Superman in the absence of any big screen outings in the 90s. Enjoying decent ratings throughout its run, it was only cancelled when Teri Hatcher became pregnant and was unable to film a fifth season – leaving the show ending on a cliffhanger (Superman and Lois are married, and a mysterious child has just appeared)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hatcher was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speaking with&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;recently about&nbsp;Lois & Clark and teased the following:</p><p>“I know I have a lot of fans that would like to see the whole show rebooted, so maybe that’ll happen. Dean and I both still have really warm feelings about our whole experience on the show. So who knows?”</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Cain’s also previously chipped in on his desire to get back in the cape, saying to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7 News Sydney</a> last year that:</p><p>“I would have liked to&nbsp;done that fifth season, I think we still need a fifth season, we need something, at least part of a fifth season. So I’m hoping that we get a chance to maybe finish up the series. Maybe it’s six episodes, maybe it’s 10 episodes, maybe it’s a two-hour movie. But I think it would be really interesting to catch up with these two characters twenty years down the line and see what’s happened in their lives. If they have had children or what’s going on with their kids, I think it’s really interesting and I’m certainly willing to.”</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>Honestly, I think revisiting a middle-aged Superman and Lois dealing with domestic life and possible super-powered children actually sounds like a pretty novel concept for a TV show. Wouldn’t you agree?</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lois_clark_ultra_woman-640x360.jpg alt=lois_clark_ultra_woman width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false>Executive Producer Eugenie Ross-Leming <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> how this might work, too, saying:</p><p>“We didn’t write it as a series finale, it was just supposed to be a cliff­hanger. Looking to create obstacles for them, we ended up saying that carrying a baby to term would kill Lois. But as fate — or intergalactic justice — would have it, a baby of Krypton lineage is left at their doorstep. If the show had gone on, we would have seen them figuring out how to raise this child, who would have aged rapidly. He would have become a teenager in months.”</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, I think it’s probably a long shot that this’ll get anywhere other than wishful thoughts.&nbsp;We already have&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Supergirl</a>&nbsp;(which Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain appear in) on The CW and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Krypton</a>&nbsp;on Syfy. As such, I can’t imagine there being much&nbsp;room for a revival of a fondly remembered 90s take on the character.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>What do you think, though?
