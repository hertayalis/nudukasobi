Prior to rekindling his relationship with his <a href=#>ex-wife Gizelle Bryant</a>, Jamal's last public relationship was with R&B singer Tweet. According to Jamal, the two dated in 2016 after establishing a friendship. Jamal took his relationship with the "Oops (Oh My)" singer public during an episode on his now-canceled talk show <a href=#>Preachers</a>. "A year ago I was walking through Times Square going to an <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> movie premiere and I bumped into R&B Singer Tweet, who is my absolute favorite female singer in the world," Jamal said in the couple's first joint interview. "...We have grown into an incredible friendship; I call her my 'Last Lady.'"</p><p dir=ltr>At the time, Tweet revealed the hardest part about dating the pastor was dealing with other women pursuing him. Per <a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a>, Jamal was accused of fathering a son with a member of his congregation at the time of the two dating. Within a year of confirming their relationship, Jamal and Tweet parted ways for undisclosed reasons.</p><p>Fortunately, Tweet says she learned a valuable lesson from her ex and wishes him well on his relationship with Gizelle. "I've learned from the past to just keep my love interests private. That was the first and last time," she told <a href=#>Hip Hollywood</a> in 2017. "I'm not hiding it, but it's just not something I want the world to judge me on."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG5ha313e8mapJqkXZe%2Fuq3NrWSoppOaeqWt056bZqyYnsBuvsFmqqKml5q%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
