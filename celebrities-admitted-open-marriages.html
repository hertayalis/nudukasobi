"We're not opposed to having somebody else join in on our sexcapades," Brody said, adding, "I truly believe a lot more people are a lot more receptive than you think. And when the conversation was brought up, Kaitlynn said, 'I actually don't mind at all.' So I was extremely excited about that."</p><p>The couple's open relationship was brought up when the pair starred in MTV's "The Hills: New Beginnings." In a 2019 <a href=#>episode</a>, when they were asked if they were in a polyamorous relationship, Brody shared, "You know, we just, we like what we like."&nbsp;Despite his not-so-clarifying answer, Carter pretty much confirmed that the couple did engage with other partners, but not without the other being present. "Everything with me and Brody is under my control, let's put it that way," Carter said on the show, per <a href=#>People</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple ended up&nbsp;splitting in&nbsp;2019 after about a six-year relationship.&nbsp;And, despite the pair tying the knot in Indonesia a year prior, they never legalized their marriage in the United States, which meant they were technically never officially husband and wife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2pnaXykscuemauhpJ6ytHnAnaSirKSasW67z56lZqWRp7%2Bqrcaeqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
