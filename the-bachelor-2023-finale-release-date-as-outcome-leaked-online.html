He has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">predicted</a> that Zach is engaged to Kaity Biggar.</p><p>“As you know the final 3 are Ariel, Kaity, and Gabi. That’s all you had up to this point. Ariel was eliminated at the overnight date rose ceremony, so your final 2 are Kaity and Gabi,” he wrote.</p><p>Although, other rumors have suggested that it was in fact Gabi to who Zach got engaged. Steve told the public it’s up to them who they want to believe, however, he “trusts his sources.”</p><p>So far, it seems like Steve’s sources have been pretty reliable as he predicted <a href=#>Zach Shallcross’ final three correctly</a> at the start of February, as well as revealing <a href=#>Charity Lawson as the next Bachelorette</a> before it was officially announced.</p><p>Well, whatever the outcome, Steve says it’s going to make a great finale night, and we can agree with him on that one.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Bachelor (@bachelorabc)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqsCiedGemKWhpK56tcKOrZ%2BeZZKWsKmxy6ipaKyYmnqjrcKhnKWnomJ%2FcX6SZp2ippGhsm6%2BxKWcmquVYrGiwMRmmKxln6rBpLvMnmSlnZGgsqV5zqejoqaV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
