The Bear premiered all eight episodes of the first season on June 23, making them available to stream on Hulu. If you’ve missed The Bear, it’s a series set in Chicago that follows a young chef who returns to run his family sandwich shop after the death of his brother. The series follows him as he gets to know his kitchen staff and his cousin while working on making the restaurant a success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/the-bear-show-900x506.jpg><p>The Bear stars Jeremy Allan White in the lead role as Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Ayo Edebiri, Abby Elliott, Lionel Boyce, Liza Colón-Zayas, Edwin Lee Gibson, and Matty Matheson also star. Guest stars for the first season included Joel McHale, Molly Ringwald, and Jon Bernthal. Christopher Storer and Joanna Calo are co-showrunners and executive producers on the series. Hiro Murai, Nate Matteson, and Josh Senior also serve as EPs. It’s no surprise that The Bear will be returning for another season. If you take a look at the <a href=#>Rotten Tomatoes</a> score, you’ll see that it currently has a 100% from critics and 92% from audiences. This is no easy feat, but it seems well-earned.</p><p>The Bear continues to help cement FX as one of the best TV channels for creatives today. FX recently renewed one of its other new series, The Old Man which features <a href=#>Jeff Bridges</a> as a former CIA operative living off the grid and dealing with his past. The critically acclaimed vampire comedy <a href=#>What We Do in the Shadows </a>was also renewed for two more seasons, with the fourth season currently airing on the network. FX is also home to critically acclaimed series like Reservation Dogs, Devs, Snowfall, Better Things, and many more.</p><p>The Bear also continues executive producer <a href=#>Hiro Murai’s</a> very successful relationship with FX. Murai is a director, producer, and executive producer on FX’s arguably best show, Atlanta. Murai has also directed for the FX shows Snowfall and Legion. Atlanta recently aired its third season to the expected critical acclaim. Atlanta will also be returning for a fourth and final season. The decision to end the series was made by show creator Donald Glover, who originally wanted to end the show after Season 2. He then expressed to FX Entertainment President Eric Schrier that he had ideas for two more seasons and it seems they were happy to give that to him. Apparently, the fourth season of Atlanta was filmed back-to-back with the third season, so we should get more episodes sooner than later.</p><p>Although fans will be disappointed to see the thoughtful and engaging Atlanta end, it seems like FX has plenty of new shows ready to take up the torch for high-quality television. If shows like The Bear continue to release high-quality seasons, we can no doubt expect FX to remain a powerhouse in the TV industry. There’s no official release date yet for the second season of The Bear, but we can expect to see episodes sometime in 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ismJp6o7HAq2SfsF2nsq%2Bx1p6bZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
