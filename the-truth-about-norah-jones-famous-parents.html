Despite Shankar's impressive resume (he was a mentor to The Beatles' George Harrison, to list one accomplishment), Jones was tight-lipped about her dad."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Ravi Shankar (pictured above right), a "sitar virtuoso and composer" who "created a passion" for "classical Indian music," as <a href=#>The New York Times</a> described, was reportedly 59 and had a son with his first wife,&nbsp;Annapurna Devi, at the time of Jones' birth.</p><p>Despite <a href=#>Shankar's impressive resume</a> (he was a <a href=#>mentor to The Beatles' George Harrison</a>, to list one accomplishment), Jones was tight-lipped about her dad.&nbsp;"I don't like talking about him because he doesn't have anything to do with me or my music," she revealed to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> in 2004. The "Shoot the Moon" singer had provided context for this in 2002, telling <a href=#>The&nbsp;Guardian</a>, "Although I love my dad very much, I did only spend a fraction of my adolescence around him. This is probably why I try to downplay our relationship in the press."</p><p><a href=#>Shankar died in 2012</a> at age 92, with Jones stating about the death, per&nbsp;<a href=#>NME</a>, "My dad's music touched millions of people. He will be greatly missed by me and music lovers everywhere." Before Shankar's death, the musician&nbsp;<a href=#>told</a> Oprah Winfrey in 2003 that she and her dad had "gotten close in the last five years."</p><p>As for Sue, her bond with Jones is strong.&nbsp;"We talk every day on the phone, no matter what," the singer relayed to Winfrey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2lmbIFxe9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2jvLOtx2ahqKaVqHqnrcyorKxloJa%2FprrTrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
