While the Kardashian family attended their eldest sister’s most important day, an essential guest was missing from the big day. I’m not talking about Scott Disick, but Kourtney’s baby brother, Robert. Excluding the Jenner duo, not only Robert Kardashian is the only Kardashian male but also the youngest."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There’s no drama between the eldest-youngest sibling of the Kardashians. Having five very successful sisters that are constantly papped or filming for The Kardashians simply wasn’t his thing.</p><p>As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six,</a> the reason why Rob missed Kourtney and Travis Barker’s wedding was reportedly because he just wasn’t feeling having cameras around him. It was also claimed that Rob is “not a big fan of public events or traveling”.</p><p>“Rob prefers to stay out of the spotlight, so he would’ve been uncomfortable going to such a high-profile party even though it was for his sister,” an insider claimed. Despite wanting his brother to be at her wedding, Kourtney understood his reasons.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-retreating-from-the-spotlight-to-live-a-private-life>Retreating from the spotlight to live a private life</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rob Kardashian, dream daddy (@robkardashianofficial)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<p>As hardcore Kar-Jenner fans might have noticed, the girls and Kris Jenner have not posted a lot of content with their beloved Rob. Not by choice, but simply because he decided to stay out of the spotlight.</p><p>Despite regularly appearing on Keeping Up With The Kardashians until a certain point, the 35-year-old hasn’t been mentioned on the new show. He also hasn’t appeared in any of the six episodes of The Kardashians that have aired so far.
