Of his<strong> 50</strong> fights, his opponent took him the distance 23 times or just under half the time he stepped into the ring.</p><p>Within the boxing community, however, many believe Floyd Mayweather ‘s record should actually be<strong> 49-1.</strong> There is dispute about one particular fight where Mayweather was outclassed most of the contest and behind statistically, but judges still awarded him the victory.

Lederman’s scorecard reflected that as he scored the fight 115-111 in favor of Castillo.</p><h2>How many wins did Floyd Mayweather have?</h2><p>His record is stellar: He has never lost a fight, posting<strong> 50</strong> wins, including 27 KOs, and no losses.
