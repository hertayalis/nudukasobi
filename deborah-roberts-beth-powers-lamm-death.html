The 20/20 anchor, who is married to <a href=# rel=noopener>Today‘s Al Roker</a>, announced the heartbreaking news on Instagram on July 2, sharing <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">several photos</a> of herself and Lamm from over the years, including a throwback from the late journalist’s wedding.</p><p>The two women met over three decades ago while working in local television in Orlando, Florida. Despite working at “competing stations,” Roberts and Lamm formed a deep bond that endured for many years. “If you’re fortunate in life, you connect with someone who becomes a lifelong friend. A confidant. A champion. A listener. A kind soul. An unending source of goodness. Beth Powers Lamm has been that and so much more for 3 decades,” Roberts wrote in the caption.</p><p>Of their 30+ years of friendship, Roberts recalled: “The years ushered in roaring bouts of laughter, weekend spa visits, political debates, beautiful weddings, and a cherished, unwavering friendship. Then, children, careers and life stole much of our time … Yet, Beth and I never missed a beat during a precious phone call, even after an embarrassing amount of time had gone by.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Deborah-Roberts-1.jpg alt="Deborah Roberts" width=1327 height=774 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“Her light, ever so bright, has now gone out. It’s a shattering loss for those of us who loved her. The world has lost a beautiful soul. But heaven just gained one. Rest in peace Beth,” she concluded.</p><p>According to her former news station,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Orlando’s NBC affiliate WESH 2</a>, Lamm passed away a week ago at age 63 following a battle with cancer. “When viewers watched Beth, I’m sure they saw someone with a warm smile, but they also sensed that she was a diligent broadcaster who worked hard to ensure she was reporting facts,” WESH 2 News reporter Greg Fox said in a statement.</p><p>Lamm left the television industry in the mid ’90s after she met her husband, Jim Lamm. The couple moved to South Carolina and went on to welcome two children, daughter Helen and son Danny. Up until her death, Lamm worked as a realtor.</p><p>Roberts, for her part, left her Orlando station in 1990 to join NBC News as a general-assignment reporter, and later, a correspondent for <i>Dateline</i>. She was then recruited by her mentor, Barbara Walters, to work at ABC News’ 20/20 as a correspondent. After 28 years with the network, Roberts was promoted to permanent co-anchor of 20/20, joining David Muir, who had been anchoring the program since 2013. Roberts replaced Amy Robach, who was dismissed following an investigation into her <a href=# rel=noopener>workplace romance with T.J. Holmes</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>More:</strong> See Who’s Leaving ABC News in 2024</a></p><p>“I have some news to share. I am thrilled and humbled to step into the role as co anchor @abc2020 alongside my friend and colleague @davidmuirabc,” Roberts wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> at the time. “We are proud to carry on the tradition of in-depth reporting on this venerable newsmagazine which has revealed truths and opened hearts and minds for 46 years, beginning with the great Barbara Walters and Hugh Downs. It is the thrill of a lifetime to travel the path which Barbara cleared for women like me who dreamed of reporting meaningful and life changing stories.”</p><p><strong>For more on ABC News, check out this gallery on <a href=# rel=noopener>the Good Morning America anchor’s real-life partners</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvY2x9eH6OnZybp6KWtW6%2Bzpucq6yjYq%2BmwMdmp6ivlafAbrjApqRmnJWWwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
