The ladies currently do not follow each other on Instagram. Also, there is no evidence supporting that they have put the past behind.</p><p>As a refresher, Stacy knew that she wanted Izzy from the beginning of the experiment. But when she realized that she and Johnie were both swooning over the same guy, she decided to stay quiet and prove to Izzy that she was the one for him. It appeared this strategy worked well for her.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>However, even though Stacy won Izzy, she still seemed extremely irritated when Johnie showed up at the get-together in Episode 7.

I see why Stacy isnâ€™t a fan of Johnie but sheâ€™s also a loser for being so geeked at her man making a girl cry <a href=#>#LoveIsBlind</a></p>â€” Bola Miami ðŸ’• (@ItsPrecious_x) <a href=#>September 30, 2023</a></figure><p>However, she claimed that Johnie began talking smack about her when it was all out in the open about Izzy and Stacy's relationship. (Note: There isn't actually confirmation of this â€” at least not on camera.)</p><p>Izzy definitely did not make things better between Stacy and Johnie. While he possibly had the power to unite these women, he seemingly had a huge change of heart about Johnie. At the get-together, he told her that she was "sketchy" and dragged her for hurting Chris, even though Chris seemed OK about everything. It seemed as if Izzy and Stacy were tag-teaming up against Johnie.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Izzy ever apologize to Johnie?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It appears that Izzy and Johnie might be on good terms after their wild fight. They currently follow each other on Instagram and even like each other's pictures. Given the way the fight ended, we're assuming it was Izzy who realized he had been too hard on Johnie and apologized to her.</p><p>Watch Love Is Blind Season 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGir9hmmKecXZ%2B8qbrInmSnp6diubDCxGagrGWSobavsA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
